          I’m not cool when it comes to fashion. I rarely take risks with my
          wardrobe and I tend to have the same outfit formula time and time
          again. But there was one trend I was kind of excited about: barrel
          jeans.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can’t remember which influencer introduced me to the horseshoe jean,
          but I was intrigued. I’ve always liked a wider shape, and these looked
          pretty cool. Ultimately, I didn’t feel like disappointing myself since
          I had a feeling they’d be overwhelming on me – so I didn’t try them
          out.

          What I love about them is that they work for my 5’3 frame. While
          they’re definitely a wider leg, they have a tapered ankle. You get the
          curved “barrel” shape with the help of seams or darts — adding volume
          to the lower body, but also stays cinched at the waist. It’s all about
          balance.

          These are the most recent pair I got. I thought the shape plus the
          distressing was pretty interesting. I had to get them for important
          research;) I really love them. I think they’re a cool jean to have in
          your closet, and they’re at an amazing price!

          This pair was the one that got me into barrel jeans. They’re almost
          *too* subtle, but in the best way possible…you know? I tried on three
          different sizes, and going one size down from my typical denim size
          ended up looking the best on me!
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, I’m always looking for pieces that make me feel
          effortlessly cool. And that’s how barrel jeans makes me feel!!
